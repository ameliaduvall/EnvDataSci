### Requirements

This course will revolve around hands-on exercises that demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly recommneded to bring their own laptop to class, but students are certainly free to work with one another. Lecture materials will be available via the course website before class, and students are encouraged to review them beforehand.

We will be using the free desktop version of the [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop/) integrated development environment (IDE) for the [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) computing software. We will also be using various packages not contained in the base installation of **R**, but we will install them as the course progresses.
