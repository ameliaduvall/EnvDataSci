## Overview

This course will provide an overview of tools and best practices that can be used to create transparent and reproducible workflows when working with environmental data. Topics include:

* Version control with **git**  

* Using **Github** to manage projects

* Data organization, documentation, and accessibility

* Accessing remote data repositories

* Using **Rmarkdown** to combine text, equations, and code in reports and presentations

* Creating dynamics reports with **Shiny**

This course will revolve around hands-on exercises that demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly recommended to bring their own laptop to class, although students are certainly free to work with one another. Lecture materials will be available via the course website before class, and students are encouraged to review them beforehand.

## Pre-requisites

Students should have a working knowledge of the [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) computing software, such as that provided in FISH 552/553. 

## Requirements

We will be using the free desktop version of the [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop/) integrated development environment (IDE) for **R**.  We will also be using various packages not contained in the base installation of **R**, but we will install them as the course progresses.
