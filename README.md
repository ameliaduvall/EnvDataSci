# Intro to Environmental Data Science

Welcome to the course materials for "Intro to Environmental Data Science" offered during Winter 2020 in the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences.


## Instructor

[**Mark Scheuerell**](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/mark-scheuerell/), Associate Professor  
School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences

Office: Rm 220A Fisheries Science

Email: [scheuerl@uw.edu](mailto:scheuerl@uw.edu)


## Course outline

### Meeting times

MWF at {time} in Rm {room number} Fisheries Science
  
Office hours by appointment.

### Pre-requisites

Students should have a working knowledge of the [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) computing software, such as that provided in FISH 552/553. 

### Credits

This course is {X} credits.

### Hardware

This course will revolve around hands-on computing exercises that demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly recommended to bring their own laptop to class, although students are certainly free to work with one another. For students without access to a personal laptop: it is now possible to check out UW laptops for an entire quarter. See the [Student Services office](https://education.uw.edu/admissions/office-of-student-services) for details.

### Software

All of the software we will be using is platform independent, meaning students are free to use macOS, Linux, or Windows operating systems. In addition to a web browser, students will need to have the following software installed on their computer.

#### git

We will be using [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a free and open source distributed "version control system" for tracking changes to our files. 

#### R & R Studio

We will be using the free [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) software and the desktop version of the [**R Studio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop/) integrated development environment (IDE).  We will also be using various packages not contained in the base installation of **R**, but we will wait and install them at the necessary time.

#### GitHub

Students will be required to have a user account on **GitHub**, which we will be using for file hosting, project management, and some communications. If you do not already have an account, you can sign up for a free one [here](**GitHub**).


## Course overview

Science is about the discovery and sharing of information, but much of the process is often shrouded in mystery. The seemingly endless competition for limited research funding has led to the notions that "knowledge is power" and that data must be protected. These situations tend to slow scientific discovery by hindering larger synthesis efforts and the exploration of new ideas or methodologies. In addition, we are witnessing increasing examples where scientists are unable to successfully reproduce previous findings, bringing into question the integrity of the results. Fortunately, however, we also find ourselves in the midst of an expanding community of developers and practioners of the tools and skills necessary for easier and more transparent design, analysis, and reporting of scientific studies. These advancements have also supported better documentation, management, and access to data, which has facilitated new and often remote collaborations. This course will provide an overview of some so-called "open science" tools and best practices that can be used to create transparent and reproducible workflows when working with environmental data.

## Learning objectives

By the end of the quarter, students should be able to:

* Use **git** to commit changes to files, recover old versions, push/pull changes to remote repositories, and manage merge conflicts

* Use **GitHub** to create repositories, manage projects, open/comment/close issues, and submit pull requests

* Clean a messy data file in **R** using a variety of packages::functions

* Properly describe and document data using **Ecological Metadata Language**

* Use unit tests in **R** to evaluate code functionality

* Create a package in **R** and document its contents

* Use **R Markdown** to combine text, equations, code, tables, and figures into reports, websites, and presentations

* Create dynamic html reports with **Shiny**
