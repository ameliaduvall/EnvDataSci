# Intro to Environmental Data Science

Welcome to the course materials for "Intro to Environmental Data Science" offered during Winter 2020 in the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences.


## Instructor

[**Mark Scheuerell**](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/mark-scheuerell/), Associate Professor

School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences

Office: Rm 220A Fisheries Science

Email: [scheuerl@uw.edu](mailto:scheuerl@uw.edu)


## Course outline

### Meeting times

MWF at {time} in Rm {room number} Fisheries Science
  
Office hours by appointment.

### Pre-requisites

Students should have a working knowledge of the [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) computing software, such as that provided in FISH 552/553. 

### Credits

This course is {X} credits.

### Hardware

This course will revolve around hands-on computing exercises that demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly recommended to bring their own laptop to class, although students are certainly free to work with one another. For students without access to a personal laptop: it is now possible to check out UW laptops for an entire quarter. See the [Student Services office](https://education.uw.edu/admissions/office-of-student-services) for details.

### Software

All of the software we will be using is platform independent, meaning students are free to use macOS, Linux, or Windows operating systems. In addition to a web browser, students will need to have the following software installed on their computer.

#### git

We will be using [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a free and open source distributed "version control system" for tracking changes to our files. 

#### R & RStudio

We will be using the free [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) software and the desktop version of the [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop/) integrated development environment (IDE).  We will also be using various packages not contained in the base installation of **R**, but we will wait and install them at the necessary time.

#### GitHub

Students will be required to have a user account on **GitHub**, which we will be using for file hosting, project management, and some communications. If you do not already have an account, you can sign up for a free one [here](**GitHub**).


## Course overview

This course will provide an overview of tools and best practices that can be used to create transparent and reproducible workflows when working with environmental data. Topics include:

* Version control with **git**  

* Using **Github** to manage projects

* Data organization, documentation, and accessibility

* Accessing remote data repositories

* Using **Rmarkdown** to combine text, equations, and code in reports and presentations

* Creating dynamics reports with **Shiny**

Lecture materials will be available via the course website before class, and students are encouraged to review them beforehand.
